**Fixed:**

- DEB package now has priority optional, because extra is deprecated
- \_\_pycache\_\_ folder with appropriate permissions is created during the installation for Python to be able to generate precompiled bytecode

The binaries can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/vsvyatski/kmeldb-ui/releases/tag/v0.3.2).

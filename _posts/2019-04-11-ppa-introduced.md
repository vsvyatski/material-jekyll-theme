Today I have published a PPA archive for the following versions of Ubuntu: Xenial Xerus (16.04 LTS), Bionic Beaver (18.04 LTS) and Cosmic Cuttlefish (18.10). Of course, it is applicable to their derivatives as well. The PPA can be accessed through [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~vsvyatski/+archive/ubuntu/kmeldb-ui). From your terminal run:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vsvyatski/kmeldb-ui
sudo apt-get update
# and if you never installed it before
sudo apt install kmeldb-ui
```

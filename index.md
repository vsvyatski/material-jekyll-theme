title: Kenwood Database Generator
---
Kenwood Database Generator is a replacement of Kenwood Music Editor Light for Linux. Basically it represents a graphic shell for [kmel_db command line utility](https://github.com/chrrrisw/kmel_db) created by Chris Willoughby.

## Purpose

It takes a FAT32 formatted USB drive with MP3 and WMA files and then creates a Kenwood DAP database on that drive, containing info about those files. The database can be later accessed by Kenwood Car Audio to index and play audio files. I created this application because the original Kenwood Music Editor light doesn't work on Linux.
